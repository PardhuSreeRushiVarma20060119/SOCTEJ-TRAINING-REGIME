> **Note** <br>

> The challenges are designed to be completed in a specific order, with each challenge building upon the previous one. However, participants are free to attempt the challenges in any order they prefer.

## Environment Setup

To ensure a secure and efficient analysis environment, follow these steps:

- Isolated Virtual Machine: Use a dedicated virtual machine (VM) for DFIR LABS challenges. Recommended platforms include VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V. Ensure the VM is configured with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and disk space) for smooth operation.

- Operating System: Install a clean version of Windows or any favourable OS. Apply all security patches and updates.

- Network Configuration: Disable internet access on the VM to prevent unintended data exfiltration or malware communication. Use a host-only or internal network configuration.

- Forensic Tools: Install industry-standard forensic tools, such as Autopsy, Volatility, or FTK Imager, depending on the nature of the challenge. Ensure all tools are updated to their latest stable versions.

- Snapshot Management: Take an initial snapshot of the VM after setup and before beginning any analysis. This allows for easy rollback in case of system compromise or misconfiguration.

- Secure Storage: Store challenge files and findings in an isolated container.
