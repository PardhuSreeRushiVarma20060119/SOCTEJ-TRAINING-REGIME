## Challenge Description 

Gotham is shrouded in darkness as you receive an urgent message from an anonymous source: A stolen code could threaten the city. You rush to your computer, only to discover that vital files are missing. The only clue is a mysterious note left behind, hinting at a hidden treasure buried within the depths of your system.

As you dig deeper, the flickering lights of your apartment signal an incoming storm—just as your system suddenly crashes, locking you out of everything. In the chaos, whispers of the Dark Knight’s presence linger in the air. Was he protecting you, or is there more to this enigma?

Now, as the clock ticks down, you must piece together the clues scattered throughout your system before Gotham falls into chaos. Can you outsmart the darkness and restore the stolen code?

Note: This challenge doesn't have any questions but the flag itself!
