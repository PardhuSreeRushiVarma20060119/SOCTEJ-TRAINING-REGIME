## Description

  Yesterday started like any other day, just casually browsing the internet. That was until I stumbled upon something... interesting. I’m not exactly sure what it was, but soon after, my files became inaccessible.
  Panicking, I remembered what a friend (he is Chizuru's Fiancée) once told me: "If you ever find suspicious files, make sure to permanently delete them."

  So I did. I deleted everything that looked even remotely suspicious.
  No backups, no analysis, just gone.
  Now I regret it deeply. Maybe if I had taken the time to investigate, there would’ve been a way to access my files again. But now all I have is a mystery... and a mess.

  Can you figure out what happened and uncover what I destroyed?
